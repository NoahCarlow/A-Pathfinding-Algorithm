# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualized
## Programmed in Python using the Pygame Module

To Install Pygame:
> pip install pygame    : Windows
> pip3 install pygame   : MAC

A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.
