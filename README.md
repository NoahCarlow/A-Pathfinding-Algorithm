# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualized
## Programmed in Python using the Pygame Module

To Install Pygame:
> pip install pygame    : Windows
<br></br>
> pip3 install pygame   : MAC

Directions:
> Left Click to place start and end node
<br></br>
> Place barriers with left click after start and end node have been placed
<br></br>
> Delete barriers with right click
<br></br>
> Hit 'C' to clear the board
<br></br>
> Hit 'R' to randomly generate barriers
<br></br>
> Hit 'Space' to start the algorithm

A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory.
